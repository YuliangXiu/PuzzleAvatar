PuzzleAvatar reconstructs a textured 3D clothed human from **unconstrained photo collections**.

|             Works On              |      Without Requiring or Being Limited by      |
| :-------------------------------: | :---------------------------------------------: |
|      ✅ Any number of photos      | ❌ Human body pose (3D HPS, 2D Keypoints, etc.) |
|          ✅ In any poses          |                 ❌ Camera pose                  |
|         ✅ From any views         |     ❌ Geometric cues (depth, normal, etc.)     |
| ✅ With any cropping or occlusion |             ❌ Re-projection losses             |
| ✅ Any A-posed body mesh template |  ❌ SMPL-(X/H), GHUM, Frank, Adam, SCAPE, etc   |

## News :triangular_flag_on_post:

- [2024/11/09] [PuzzleIOI](https://github.com/YuliangXiu/PuzzleAvatar?tab=readme-ov-file#dataset-and-benchmark) dataset and benchmark code get released.
- [2024/09/10] [PuzzleAvatar](https://github.com/YuliangXiu/PuzzleAvatar) code gets released.
- [2024/05/23] [PuzzleAvatar](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14869) paper gets released.

<br/>

## Getting Started

1. Set up the paths in `scripts/env.sh`.
2. Please follow the [Installation Instruction](install.md) to setup all the required packages.
3. Run PuzzleAvatar (Grounded-SAM $\rightarrow$ PuzzleBooth $\rightarrow$ SDS, takes about 4 hours)

```bash
# For custom data
bash scripts/run.sh data/human/yuliang results/human/yuliang human_yuliang

# For PuzzleIOI
bash scripts/run.sh data/PuzzleIOI/puzzle_capture/03632/outfit13 results/PuzzleIOI/puzzle_capture/03632/outfit13 03632_outfit13
```

The results will be saved in the experiment folder `results/human/yuliang`, and `results/PuzzleIOI/puzzle_capture/03632/outfit13`.

## Dataset and Benchmark

<div align="center">
    <img src="assets/dataset.png" width="80%"/>
</div>

1. Register at [puzzleavatar.is.tue.mpg.de](https://puzzleavatar.is.tue.mpg.de/)
2. Download datasets (194GB) with registered *username* and *password*
```bash
bash scripts/fetch_data.sh
```
3. For evaluation / benchmark
```bash
# render the reconstruction results (4 views)
# If the rendering process is stuck, please refer to the changes for PRT computation:
# https://github.com/YuliangXiu/ICON/pull/237/files

python -m render.render_batch_result -headless -out_dir ./results/ -split test

# calculate both 3D metrics (Chamfer, P2S, NC) and 2D metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS)
python -m multi_concepts.benchmark -split test
```
